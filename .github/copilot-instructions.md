- Implement proper state management for goal tracking and progress monitoring
- Use modern CSS or CSS-in-JS for styling
- Ensure responsive design for multiple device types
- Implement local storage for data persistence
- Focus on clean, maintainable code architecture

## Key Features to Implement
- Goal creation and management interface
- OKR tracking dashboard
- Progress visualization and analytics
- Weekly review workflow
- Accountability and reminder systems
- Export/import functionality for goal data

When generating code, prioritize user experience, data integrity, and scalable architecture patterns.
